                                    <p>I started brainstorming card view layout ideas by sketching and quick wireframing and narrowed down to four versions. 
                                    After discussing with team, I decided to go with the version 4 for two reasons: <strong>1) the style matches with CORE as grey is the main color;
                                    2) the design is easy to view</strong> where the top section contains the most important information such as task title, deadline
                                    and status, and the bottom section includes the rest of the information. </p>

                                    <h4>Iterate On the Card Design</h4>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Different from web browser, too much information on mobile devices could be overwhelming. After deciding the general layout of the card, I needed to decide what information to keep or
                                    exclude. Working with the engineer team who is one of the major users of CORE, I <strong>further iterated on the card design and prioritized information on the card based on user's needs.</strong> </p>

                                    have <strong>minimum touch target size</strong> and buttons are <strong>within the thumb zones. </strong>

                                    what deadlines are approaching. After some research on how users usually deal with deadlines and how important they are, 
                                    I realized that <strong>for some users, deadlines are not specified in the task description but it still needs to be done within 
                                    a time frame, while for users like engineers, deadlines are really important.</strong> To fulfill the need both user groups, I started exploring different 
                                    approaches for user-directed prioritization.</p>

                                    <p>Currently in CORE, users are able to mark institutions that the company works with favorite and the list of marked items appears in the employee profile page.
                                    The design team suggested to enable the favorite feature not limited to institutions but to other items such as tasks, activities, tickets and so on. Once I settled 
                                    down with creating To Do List on dashboard, I started exploring different ways Favorites could be presented. I experimented on few options:

                                    <p>I made decision to <strong>put Favorites in Dashboard for quick view</strong> and <strong>in a separate page accessed from the side bar navigation for editing</strong> 
                                    by answering two questions:1) When do users need to use Favorites;
                                    2) Where provides the quick and easy access to Favorites. </p>

                                <p>What I love about interning at MIM was that I was able to take on different scales of projects. Sometimes 
                                I was doing micro design changes based on CORE users' requests and the designs were shipped immediately by the developers, while other times I was able to take on bigger projects like the 
                                design work mentioned above. Even though I didn't get the chance to see Mobile CORE and new Dashboard shipped by the developers, I still had the opportunity to work with other teams and 
                                learn from the design process. Dialpad Caller will be shipped around September 2020. </p>

                                    <p>During the first few weeks of the internship, I was afraid to show my ideas/sketches in the early stage of the design process. Before progress 
                                    checks-ins with the design lead, I always wanted to have at least some simple mock-ups ready to show. However, sometimes I didn't realize that I 
                                    went to the wrong direction until finishing building the mock-ups. Get feedback in the early stage could be impactful. It helped me to better understand the problem
                                    and iterate more effectively. </p>

                                    <p>Design involves interdisciplinary groups. I've worked with engineers, data analyst, and customer support team.
                                    I learned how to convey my idea in various ways to different audience, such as changing use of language or walking through a user scenario.
