                                        want to know about COVID-19. Then I quickly put up a simple affinity wall with the insights collected from people. Three categories of needs could
                                        be identified: <br><br>1) more personalized news relevant to cities/towns where people live; <br>2) grocery shopping guide/stock information during pandemic; <br>3) neighborhood

                                        <p>A lot of people around me shared their concerns about shopping safely and essential goods being out of stock during pandemic. <b>What if

                            <p>During the 7-day challenge, I learned not to hang up on one thought for too long and make decision faster but carefully.
                            There was time when I was struggling about how notification feature could cover all use cases, but I realized that if I am a user, 
                            I wouldn't want to read all the options about notification and would rather spend more time on checking if my item is in stock or not. 
                            So I decided to keep it simple and made decision for users in this case. I am grateful that I could use this opportunity to challenge myself and 
                            try to solve a problem within a short time period. </p><br>

                            <p>When I was doing the user testing, some users reflect that this app could be used <b>not only during pandemic
                                but any situation when the essential items are low in stock.</b> For next step, I would like to see how the current
                                design could be adapted to various circumstances and make design changes accordingly.
