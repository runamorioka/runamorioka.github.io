                      She signed up with her email and entered her home address. Soon enough, Abby saw a list of

                      that <b>she only needs to wait for 30 minutes around 12:30 PM.</b> She thought "I am going there around
                      12:30 then!". Abby saw sanitizer at Tom's Grocery is out of stock but she <b>added to her list so she 
                      can check back later.</b>

                          "Local Market has all of them!" Abby decided to go to Local Market instead of Tom's Grocery.

                          was in the line waiting, she opened her eazibuy account and <b>saw sanitizer and toilet are in her

                          fact she saw. After reading through it, she thought <b>"Now I know better what to do after buying
                          grocery."</b> She <b>added the fact to her list so she wouldn't forget</b> some of the tips.

                  <h3>Sketch</h3><br>
                  <p>With the basic structure of the application in mind, I started sketching simple user interface of the application and shared my ideas
                  with few users to test on before starting a mid-fidelity prototype. </p>

                  <strong style="color:#5FC9B0;font-size:25px;">3.</strong> <strong>Fact Check is searchable by keywords. </strong> Instead of browsing some facts, users are more interested in searching the topics they want to see.</p>

                <h1 id="takeaway">What I have learned?</h1><br><br>
                <p>During the 7-day challenge, I learned not to hang up on one thought for too long and make decision faster but carefully.
                There was time when I was struggling about how notification feature could cover all use cases, but I realized that if I am a user, 
                I wouldn't want to read all the options about notification and would rather spend more time on checking if my item is in stock or not. 
                So I decided to keep it simple and made decision for users in this case. I am grateful that I could use this opportunity to challenge myself and 
                try to solve a problem within a short time period. </p><br><br><br><br>
              
                <h1>Look beyond pandemic</h1><br>
                <p>When I was doing the user testing, some users reflect that this app could be used <b>not only during pandemic
                    but any situation when the essential items are low in stock.</b> For next step, I would like to see how the current
                    design could be adapted to various circumstances and make design changes accordingly.
